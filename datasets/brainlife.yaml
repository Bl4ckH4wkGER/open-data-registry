Name: Brainlife
Description: >
  brainlife.io provides a large collection of open-access neuroscience datasets, primarily focused on human brain imaging. 
  These datasets include diffusion MRI (dMRI), structural MRI (T1w, T2w), functional MRI (fMRI), and other neuroimaging modalities. 
  Many datasets are derived from well-known studies and organized in the BIDS (Brain Imaging Data Structure) format, making them 
  easy to integrate into standardized processing pipelines. 
  The data is curated to support research in connectomics, brain development, neurodegenerative diseases, and machine learning 
  applications in neuroscience.

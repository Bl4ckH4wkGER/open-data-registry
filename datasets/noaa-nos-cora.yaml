Tags: Ocean, atmosphere, climate, flood risk planning, transportation, restoration, weather, waves, storm modeling, hydrodynamic modeling

Description: |
  NOAA's [Coastal Ocean Reanalysis (CORA)](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/cora.html) for the Gulf, East Coast/Atlantic, and Caribbean (GEC) is produced using verified hourly water levels from the National Ocean Service’s [Center of Operational Oceanographic Products & Services](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/) (CO-OPS).  [ADvanced CIRCulation Model (ADCIRC)](https://www.erdc.usace.army.mil/Media/Fact-Sheets/Fact-Sheet-Article-View/Article/476698/advanced-circulation-model/) and [Simulating WAves Nearshore (SWAN)](https://www.tudelft.nl/en/ceg/about-faculty/departments/hydraulic-engineering/sections/environmental-fluid-mechanics/research/swan) models are coupled to model coastal water levels and nearshore waves. Hourly water level observations are used for data assimilation and validation to improve the accuracy of modeled water levels and wave datasets.
